 <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
 <p align="justify">
   The main objective of the Python Project on Election Management System is to manage the details of election, candidates, election commission rules, election Dates,
Registration. It manages the information about Election, Votes, and Registration. The project is totally built at administrative end and thus only the administration is guaranteed the access. The purpose is to build an Application Program to reduce the manual work for managing the Elections, Candidates, Votes, and Election Commission Rules. It tracks all the details about Election Commission Rules, Votes and Registrations.

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
 <p align="justify">
   Development of Election Management System using Python- MySQL Connectivity. The project aims to manage the details of Elections, Candidates, Election Commission Rules, and Registration. The purpose of the project is to build an application to reduce the manual work for managing elections. It tracks all the Election Commission Rules, Election Dates, and Registration.
</p>

<h2 id="assump">Assumptions Made</h2>
 <p align="justify">
   The assumption made herein the Election Management System is that the candidate
names election places, party symbols and the state (from where the candidates are trying
to win seats in elections) are all virtual and based on assumptions.
</p>

<h2 id="prob">Problems Encountered</h2>
 <p align="justify">
  Problems encountered in this project of Election management System are:  <br>
   ➢ Enrolling the names of the candidates electing from different states <br>
   ➢ Updating and displaying candidate details whenever required <br>
   ➢ Removing undesirable details and records <br>
   ➢ Searching of candidate details with the help of candidate number. This eases the search for the candidate details <br>
   ➢ Sorting performed with respect to candidate number, candidate name and election states <br>
</p>
